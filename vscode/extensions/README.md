# Extensions
This directory keeps information about the different extensions that I use in VS Code. The format of the extensions names corresponds to the documentation in the [official VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_command-line-extension-management).

The general structure of this is based on self defined categories and is for now divided into the following categories:
- **Languages**: has extension names of extensions that provides language servers and snippets to different languages
- **Themes**: has extensions that provides VS Code themes and icons
- **Tools**: has extensions that provides tools to help me get things organized, planned, analyzed, or displayed in some way or another

All the above categories are created as files with a `*.extensions` filename.
